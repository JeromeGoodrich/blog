<p>So this presentation is about design smells. you know RFIVNNO...</p>
<p>But before we get into each smell. I wanted to take some time to actually explore the significance of this paradigm and why it might be worth your time to learn.</p>
<p>We describe design smells viscerally, like a 6th sense. our design nose tells us when our code is not easy to change. Unlike defects in the code, which might fail a test design is not something immediately apparent, much harder to pin down and yet vital, because as we will see the quicker we are to pick up on a design smell the better off we are.</p>
<p>Why? Well I like to think of these smells as negative rules of OO design. Having a design nose and being able to identify these smells is equivalent to an understanding of OO Design.</p>
<p>M</p>
<p>This presentation would probably be pretty dull though if I just went through each one and gave an explanation. I mean we'll probably do that, but not quite yet.</p>
<p>Instead, I'd like to probe a bit into why we'd even bother talking about design smells. So let's talk a little bit about Agile and OO design.</p>
<p>First OO. What's the ideal what do we all strive for?</p>
<p>Right changeable code - I think this really easy to take for granted and even forget.</p>

<p>Why do we even talk about design smells? Design Smells are ostensibly problems in our codebase and I like to think of them as the t=0 of Agile Development. Because agile operates under the assumption that things will go wrong. Everything we do in agile is for the purpose of preventing design smells via Agile practices like planning, pairing, refactoring, etc. or for getting rid of a smell when it comes up via principles and patterns. As such, I'd argue it's important to understand design smells, in order to understand and be effective in agile</p>
<p>What are design smells? So I mentioned that they are problems in our code base, but what does that even mean? I'd like to propose that design smells are not only problems in the code base, but a quality of it. What I mean by this, is that design smells point to our code exhibiting certain undesirable characteristics, the code could work, all the test could pass, but there is still something wrong. It's like a person on the verge of a cold, they might be functioning now, but give it a day or two and they'll be out of commission. There's a reason why they are called design smells. Because they deal with the overall design of a program, not necessarily its function though the two are often inexorably linked.</p>
<p>If the ideal of code is for it to be easily changed, then design smells are symptoms of this not being the case. Agile development is all about building code that conforms to this ideal, and therefore it is all about dealing with things that take the code further away from the ideal. There is no agile without an understanding of design smells, which we can otherwise call different ways that makes software difficult to change. When code exhibits a design smell, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's broken, but it does mean that when it does break things will often be much more difficult to fix.</p>
<p>I remember the different design smells with this clever pneumonic RFIVNNO...</p>
<p>Rigidity - implies that a piece of software is difficult to change because in order to change one thing you have to change a whole bunch of things.</p>
<p>Well we can't really talk about Agile without some acknowledgement of design smells. Agile operates under the assumption that things will go terribly wrong at some point -- and there seems to be a good amount of empirical evidence to substantiate this. So it starts with the idea that something will go wrong and it will need to be fixed. De</p>
