Life is full of ups and downs and we are often tossed about on that
rollercoaster ride. To weather those sudden drops, precipitous climbs and
disorienting loops, we need some source of stability.

Stability comes from habitsâ€“small actions we take everyday without fail.
It's not neccessarily even about _what_ the action is, but whether we do
it or not. The actions we take cast votes towards who we think we are and
that sense of identity gives us solid ground to stand on when things get
rough.

Small means that it takes 30 seconds or less to complete. Small also means
that you are done after those 30 seconds. If you feel like doing more, by
all means. But some days you aren't going to feel like doing more, and
that's ok, doing the small thing is enough.

I want to write more. This post is my small thing. Today it's more than
one sentence, but some days it won't be. I'm fine with that. Like I said
it's all about showing up.
