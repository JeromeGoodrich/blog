<p>I made some good strides to get back on track today. Did most of the things I normally do and feel much better for it. Today, I officially finished the first real "story" of my apprenticeship: making a computer player that wins 85% of the time, along with a test that proves it. </p>
<p>I way underestimated my ability to get it done (actual: 3.5 pts expected: 7.75 pts), but It still took longer than I thought. I initially thought I had finished in the morning, since the tests worked, but the requirements were actually to have the new AI playable through the command line interface. This required a lot more work than I initially thought and revealed to me how brittle my code was.</p>
<p>I had to change a lot, and eventually settled on creating a HumanPlayer type and ComputerPlayer type that both used the Player protocol, which handled the make- move function. This allowed me to get rid of my former make-move function, make my game-loop even more concise, add new options to the cli, and gave me a good opportunity to refactor my -main function.</p>
<p>Last week, Kevin suggested giving myself a stopping time since it's easy to get wrapped up in a problem and end up working late into the night. I stopped coding at 4PM, and read two chapters of PPP before blogging. I've gone through 4 of the 5 SOLID principles and am looking for another source to shore up some of the ambiguities I still have about it, since it's talked about pretty technically, and in my opinion, opaquely in PPP. </p>
<p>I'm about out of steam. Hopefully, I'll be a bit fresher for my next post.</p>
