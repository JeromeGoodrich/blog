I'm getting more in touch with my calendar. I use to only look at it for
meetings that other people put on there, but over the past week I've been
playing with putting things on there myself. It's terrifying. I feel like
I'm hurtling towards a bleak future–one in which I lose my humanity and
become a robot–life bound and dictated by what's written in my calendar.
However, the alternative seems just as bleak: A thick obliviousness to the
passage of time and propensity towards wasting as much of it as possible.

In my mind, which is so often wrong (as is the case right now), there
exists no middle-ground between these polar fates. In reality,
a compromise seems inevitable. In my experience (with the exception of
some meetings) time I have scheduled myself is very seldom wasted. This
observation precipitates all my tinkering.

As distrustful I am of calendars and all the trappings of productivity and
efficiency that they come with, It's worth playing with some ways to
capture and invest time that otherwise might be lost to dithering and the
vapid indulgences of our baser instincts.
