I love the queitude and calmness of the early morning. Time feels like
it's in abundance and the frenetic pace of life seems to slow. There's
room to indulge in self-care and to ponder, plan and prepare for the
busier feeling moments of life.

However, early morning is elusive. Linger in bed and it's gone. Without
enough rest it's grey and dead with no trace of its magic. It needs to be
seized and prioritized, otherwise it's not worth it.
