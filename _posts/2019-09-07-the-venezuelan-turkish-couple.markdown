I was struck by the positivity of a couple that I met at my
father-in-law's 80th birthday. She hailed from Caracas and he from
Istanbul, both had delightful and refreshing countenance that I found
remarkable.

Positivity can be cloying. But there was a subtlety and tact to theirs.
For one, it seemed genuine but more importantly, each positive comment,
spin, or story they told was laced with something other then good
vibesâ€“gratitude. This couple was extremely grateful. It was never just,
"Wow, that's great!" instead it was, "Wow, what a blessing it is to have
had the opportunity to experience that." It made me feel like I ought to
be grateful as well. I appreciated that.
