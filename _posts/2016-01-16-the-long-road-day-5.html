<p>It would be a mistake to think my apprenticeship is just about learning to write good code. I want to become a software craftsman, but I also want to work with people I like and who like me. Therefore, my apprenticeship is also about testing my fit with 8th Light. The best way to do that is to open up and be regular goofy self, and to understand what everyone else is about. Today, I learned a bit more about the people who make up 8th Light.</p>
<p>People at 8th Light seem to really appreciate the work-life balance that the company has seemed to institutionally encourage through things like each Friday's unstructured afternoon where everyone is free to work on whatever they please. In fact, protecting the sanctity of this time was the topic of a lively discourse during this morning's "Donut Discussion". I appreciated hearing the varying thoughts on the matter as it gave me a preliminary sense of the rich tapestry of opinions, politics (which seemed fortunately lacking), and emotions that make up 8th Light's particular company landscape. At first blush, people are smart, humble, idealistic (in a good way), affable, and they give a shit. I felt like the conversation was cut short, as I'm not particularly fond of leaving things unresolved and with out next steps, but maybe that's something I can contribute next time around.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Kevin invited me to go with a few others to a bar to hang out. It was great getting to see how everyone interacted in a different context. It turned out to be pretty much the same as when they are in the office. I take this as a good sign that people at 8th Light feel comfortable enough to be themselves. I'm not sure I'm quite there yet, but that's more a function of novelty than any sort of bad vibes. I'll come around it might just take a little bit.</p>

<p>Now for the weekend and my first improv class.</p>
