The most interesting and impactful sentence in the 400+ pages of SICP
I've read so far is the bolded sentence above. The also say as much in
the book, calling it "the most fundamental idea in programming". I'm
still gnawing on it, and while I think the importance is definitely
evident, I still struggle to explicitly state why.

The book walks through building an Lip program that evaluates Lisp
expressions aka an interpreter, and uses the analogy that a program is
simply the description of an abstract machine. An interpreter, thus is a
special type of machine that takes the description of other machines as
input, and then configures itself to emulate the machine described. This
is where I think SICP started to impress upon me just how important that
sentence is.

If you give a Lisp interpreter that evaluates Lisp expressions a Lisp
program that behaves as an interpreter for some other language like C.
The Lisp interpreter will emulate the C interpreter, and now can emulate
any machine described in Lisp. In other words, any interpreter can
emulate any other, meaning that what can be computed is independent of
the language and computer.

There's so much more to this including optimizations, different types of
interpreters(normal(lazy) vs. applicative order), the difference between
interpreters and compilers, but I think it's a fundamental topic that it
helps to have some good foundational knowledge of. So to that end, I
found [this site](http://www.sicpdistilled.com/section/4.1/) Â which
provides a distillation of some of the SICP concepts but more
importantly walks through how to actually build an interpreter in
Clojure. hopefully I can find some time to do that.
