title: Rediscovering TDD and VIM

I'm writing tests first again. It's easier when you have a guide that
pretty much tells you what to test in the form of a cob\_spec
integration test. I noticed that thanks to the short feedback loops that
TDD calls for, I was making less mistakes, and felt less scatterbrained.
It really helped me focus.

Now I have all cob\_spec tests passing and am working on adding unit
tests for the classed I did not create using TDD. I've realized that I
tend to really enjoy refactoring. Once all tests are passing I can focus
on improving the design, which is what I usually find most interesting
about writing software. I guess that's another reason to use TDD, I can
spend more time in that "mode".

Thanks to my pairing session on Friday with Kevin I'm also thinking more
about VIM and how to improve my skills with it. I notice during our
pairing session that I spend too much time in "Insert" mode, and that I
was slow because of it. In an effort to start taking my VIM practice
more seriously I stumbled across Bram Moolenar's: *Seven habits of
effective text editing*. The primary contributor to VIM suggests three
basic steps to gradually improve one's skill in text editing:

1.  While you are editing, keep an eye out for actions you repeat and/or
    spend quite a bit of time on.
2.  Find out if there is an editor command that will do this
    action quicker. Read the documentation, ask a friend, or look at how
    others do this.
3.  Train using the command. Do this until your fingers type it
    without thinking.

So I think for future blog posts I'll start including a section of
editing behaviors and VIM commands to optimize those behaviors.

-   navigation -&gt; h, j ,k ,l (**not arrow keys**)
-   faster navigation
    -   w, W = first letter of next word.
    -   e, E = last letter of current/next word.
    -   b, B = first letter of previous word.
    -   distinction  = caps goes to next space, lowercase next word.
