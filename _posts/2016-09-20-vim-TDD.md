title: TDD and Vim

When I first started working in Vim. Bram Moolenar's [_Seven Habits of Effective Text Editing_](http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html)
was very influential. In it he outlines three fundamental tips for gradually improving one's efficacy in the editor.


>    1. While you are editing, keep an eye out for actions you repeat and/or spend quite a bit of time on
>
>    2. Find out if there is an editor command that will do this action quicker. Read the documentation, ask a friend,
>       look at how others do this.
>
>    3. Train using the command. Do this until your fingers type it without thinking.


I didn't realize it at the time, but these aren't tips for a beginner. They are universal rules for bringing out
the best in this powerful editor. In Vim there is _always_ a better way to do things and that doesn't just apply to 
editing text in a conventional sense, any adjacent processes can also be optimized. 

Consider the process of TDD. There are plenty of ways we can use Vim to make the  _Red, Green, Refactor_  loop as tight and 
fast as possible. Let's take a look at each stage of the cycle and delve into what some of those optimizations might look like. 


### RED - _Writing a Failing Test_

If we're writing tests, there's going to be some basic boilerplate to write. In the case of BDD style frameworks like
Rspec and Speclj, we know we are going to be writing things this a lot:

```clojure

(describe "The App" 
  (context "Starting it up"
    (it "loads the thing we expect it to load"
      (let [something {:this "and that"}]
        (should= something something_else)))))

```

While it's not a ton of boilerplate, we'll probably writing it a fair amount. Let's make things easier by writing some basic
snippets that will significantly cut down on the amount of time we need to create this boiler plate. One really easy way to 
do this by creating some abbreviations in our `.vimrc`

`:iabbrev dci (describe " " <CR>  (context "  " <CR>  (it "  " <CR>  #body here#)))`

Now simply by typing `dci` in insert mode we can create much of the boilerplate for our tests. We can do the same for
adding just a context and it block, or just an it block -- whatever makes writing that first failing test, just a bit
easier.

We can also specify the what types of files these abbreviations work in. So that we aren't accidentally expanding Spleclj
boilerplate when we don't want to. 
                        
`:au filetype clojure :iabbrev dci, etc..`

Abbreviations work well for creating quick on the fly expansions for text you don't want to write, but for boilerplate 
code, they are at best a stop-gap solution. Much better options exist in the form of Plugins like [SnipMate](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate), and 
[UtiliSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) that were explicitly created to help Vim users quickly and easily create small reusable "snippets" of
code. I'd recommend starting off with the abbreviations first though, they might turn out to be more than enough.


### GREEN - _Passing The Failing Test_

Alright! we've now written our first failing test. How can we get to 'Green' as quickly as possible? First, we need to
actually determine that our current test failed, which means two things. 

1. We want to run our tests as soon after finishing writing them as possible
2. We want to do the least amount to actually verify that our test failed. 

Here's a common workflow I've seen and have used before.

- write a failing test
- hit `ctrl z` to 'pause' Vim and go back to terminal
- type in test command, something like `lein test` or hit the up arrow to get the most recent command
- hit enter
- wait for the test to run
- hit `fg` to return to Vim

Not bad, but there's a lot of room for error and all things considered this approach is pretty slow. If we are to follow
[Gary Bernhardt's advice](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/blog/2014/tdd-straw-men-and-rhetoric) running tests should take no more than 300 milliseconds. They should already have been run
before we even have time to think. Let's see how Vim, and a little help from [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) can get us there.

_NB: you'll need a terminal multiplexer, but tmux isn't necessary. You can also do everything I'm about to talk about in [Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/). It will just be a different
command._

First off, we want to actually see the output from running our tests so let's use tmux to open a vertical 
`prefix (usually ctrl-b) %` or a horizontal `prefix "` split. We can resize these windows with 
`prefix <option> arrow keys`. 

I like to have Vim on the left with a narrow column on the right displaying test output.

Sweet! we can now see our code and test output on the same screen. That's a huge step forward from the workflow I described
above. However, we still have some work to do. We don't want to have to switch over to our other tmux pane just to run our tests, ideally, we should never have
to leave Vim. We just want to glance over and see the error message, and then make that test pass.

Personally, I like for the tests to run as soon as I write to a buffer, but if that doesn't jive with your workflow, Vim provides 
options for other triggers as well. Here's the autocommand I typically use to run tests in a Elixir project. 

```
autocmd BufWrite * :silent exec "!tmux send-keys -t 1 C-l \"mix test\" Enter" | redraw!
```

Let's walk through it.

`autocmd BuWrite *.ex` ---
new autocommand that happens whenever we write to a buffer and filters based on the `.ex` filetype


`:silent exec` ---
`:silent` will allow us to run the command without needing to enter afterwards. `exec` will allow us to evaluate the 
proceeding string as a command.

`"!tmux send-keys -t 1 C-l \"mix test\" Enter"` ---
This is the command we actually want to execute. `!` will basically run whatever comes after is as regular terminal
command. In this case, `tmux send-keys -t 1 C-l \"mix test"\ Enter`. The only confusing bits might be the `-t 1` flag
which specifies what  pane to send the `mix test Enter`, and `C-l` will relaod that pane prior to the command being sent
so we're always working with a fresh screen. 

Finally `| redraw!` will clear the current Vim screen and redraw it. This is helpful because some times Vim can get in
a funky state after doing an external command. This just ensures we are never bothered by this occasional nuisance. 

Awesome! Now whenever we write to a buffer our tests will automatically run and we need only to have them skate across our periphery
to ensure they fail or pass.

This new efficient workflow highlights something really cool, namely that pretty much anything you can do in the
terminal you can also do in Vim. You need only choose a trigger --- some event like writing to a buffer, or
hitting a certain sequence of keys. The possibilities are endless. Just remember those three rules and do things that work
best for you.

Sweet! now that we've got a really efficient feedback loop let's write the smallest amount of code to make our test
pass. Maybe we can create some new snippets if it makes sense.

_NB: If you don't like you're screen real-estate eaten up by a Tmux column, then you might want to try out
[vim-dispatch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch). There's also plenty of Plugins that take care of helping Vim interface
with tmux. If you are finding your efficiency hampered by the limitations of the techniques I described above, I'd recommend looking into
any number of those._


### Refactor - _Stay Green, but Make Things a Little Nicer_

We are green! Let's stay that way and add some [additional rules](https://www.sitepoint.com/refactoring-workout-relentlessly-green/) that will make our feedback loop even tighter.

    
- We should run our tests after every change -- _This shouldn't be a problem, given our new workflow_
- If a change produces a failing test, it should only take one undo to get us back to green.

Given that a change can be something as small as replacing a letter in a word. We want to make sure that we pack as much
as possible into the changes we make, while keeping the execution of those changes as simple as possible. This can take
many different forms, but I like to keep things simple and try as much as much as possible to think in terms of
`Verb  - Modifier  - Action`. For example, `d`elete `i`n `w`ord or `y`ank `a`round `p`aragraph. I don't need much else.
Eventually I might get to the point wher I find these simple actions repetitive and look for a way of doing them faster
,but that time has not yet arrived, and until then I think the best thing we can do to make our code cleaner while
staying green is to focus on the fundamentals.


### Wrapping Things Up

As I mentioned before, TDD is not a special process -- This approach, those three simple rules can be applied to any aspect
of our workflow. We just have to be constantly vigilant of how we can improve.
