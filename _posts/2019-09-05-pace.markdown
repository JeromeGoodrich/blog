The more we feel like we are running out of time, the faster time seems to
pass. It's as if the universe wants us to enjoy the time we have and not
focus on that which we've lost or will lose. The rate at which time passes
is always the sameâ€“a second is a second, whether it's today or 10 years
from now. The rate at which time _seems_ to pass varies greatly. This
interal time is what I call "pace". Finding your pace is and living as
much of life in it, is one of the keys to enjoying the time you have.

I've found that I thrive at a slower, unhurried pace. I like longer days
that move forward steadily without urgency. To live at this pace, I have
to wake-up early or make time the night before to prepare for the coming
day. Without that, I find that I tend to be very reactive, rushing from
one thing to the next and the pace of the day inevitably gets faster and
less enjoyable.
