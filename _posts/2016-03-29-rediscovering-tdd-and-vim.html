<p>I'm writing tests first again. It's easier when you have a guide that pretty much tells you what to test in the form of a cob_spec integration test. I noticed that thanks to the short feedback loops that TDD calls for, I was making less mistakes, and felt less scatterbrained. It really helped me focus.</p>
<p>Now I have all cob_spec tests passing and am working on adding unit tests for the classed I did not create using TDD. I've realized that I tend to really enjoy refactoring. Once all tests are passing I can focus on improving the design, which is what I usually find most interesting about writing software. I guess that's another reason to use TDD, I can spend more time in that "mode".</p>
<p>Thanks to my pairing session on Friday with Kevin I'm also thinking more about VIM and how to improve my skills with it. I notice during our pairing session that I spend too much time in "Insert" mode, and that I was slow because of it. In an effort to start taking my VIM practice more seriously I stumbled across Bram Moolenar's: <em>Seven habits of effective text editing</em>. The primary contributor to VIM suggests three basic steps to gradually improve one's skill in text editing:</p>
<ol>
<li>While you are editing, keep an eye out for actions you repeat and/or spend quite a bit of time on.</li>
<li>Find out if there is an editor command that will do this action quicker. Read the documentation, ask a friend, or look at how others do this.</li>
<li>Train using the command. Do this until your fingers type it without thinking.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I think for future blog posts I'll start including a section of editing behaviors and VIM commands to optimize those behaviors.</p>
<ul>
<li>navigation -&gt; h, j ,k ,l (<strong>not arrow keys</strong>)</li>
<li>faster navigation
<ul>
<li>w, W = first letter of next word.</li>
<li>e, E = last letter of current/next word.</li>
<li>b, B = first letter of previous word.</li>
<li>distinction  = caps goes to next space, lowercase next word.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
