Ok, with this I'll be all caught up. The last week has been a complete
routine buster. Usually, I wake up at 5 A.M., work out, make breakfast,
read a bit and maybe go for a walk. I haven't done that once this week,
and it doesn't make me feel good. It wasn't a bad week, but it did make
me realize that something is out of whack and there's a better way to do
things. The fact that I didn't blog at all this week is a testament to
that. I'll be back on track next week.

Despite, how I feel. I learned and did quite a bit this week. I built
the Minimax algorithm in Clojure, I incorporated a Command Line
interface and options parser into Tic Tac Toe, and I had my first
Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM) with Kevin and Myles. The
apprenticeship is now a bit more formalized and I'm not quite sure how I
feel about it. I think I like it, since it simulates imminent reality a
bit more, but I feel a bit stressed too, which strikes me as a bit odd.
Hopefully, it was just the excessive amounts of coffee I drank.

Finally, I have read PPP at all either. So gotta get back on track with
that too.
