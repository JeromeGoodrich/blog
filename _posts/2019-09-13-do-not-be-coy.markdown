It's more interesting to read something where the author has taken a stace
on something, and that stance is visible and upfront. For example, I much
prefer "The difference between x and y is..." to "There is a difference
between x and y". Give it to me straight. In the latter example, the
author may reveal the difference in the following sentence, but they also
might notâ€“the phrasing allows them to be ambiguous and not need to state
any opinions.

If you're writing from your own experience, be opinionated. Your
experience is by nature subjective. There's no need to be coy. If you find
yourself using vagueness to impart an air of objectivity to your writing
because "you don't have an opinion", then do the work required for having
an opinion. Research both sides of a topic, if you see merits on either
side, than that itself can be your opinion.

Mind you, opinions change. You will inevitably end up disagreeing with
something you wrote. It's not a reflection on your credibility as
a writer. People change. Their thinking changes. I would find it more
concerning if you were to agree with everything you've ever written. Don't
let the fear of future contradictions keep you from drawing your line in
the sand right now.
