<p>I spent all of today plowing through the <a href="http://clojurekoans.com/">Clojure Koans</a> and learning more about Vim. In an effort to understand some concepts more deeply, I supplemented some my journey through the Koans with these <a href="http://www.clojurescreencasts.com/koans-walkthrough/01.html">helpful videos</a>. I started leaning on them a bit for and after the 14th Koan (recursion). I just finished the 16th.</p>
<p>Interestingly, most of my frustration with Clojure is cosmetic. I have a tough time figuring out when and what to indent so that I can still see the overall structure of a function or expression. This caused some headaches along the way, but as I see more and more of the language and its conventions, I'm sure I'll get used to it.</p>
<p>On the Vim front, I took a short Vim tutorial online and learned some basic hot keys. I retained a sliver of what was shown, but I think as the need comes up to use them I'll become increasingly adept.</p>
<p>A continuing thought from yesterday relies on my typing. I'm thinking it might behoove me to take one of those typing tutors that will teach me the proper way to use the keyboard. It willÂ be infuriating at first but hopefully worth it in the long run.</p>
