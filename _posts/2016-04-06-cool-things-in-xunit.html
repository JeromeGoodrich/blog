<p>So far, I really appreciate and enjoy practicing the prime factors kata and the idea of practicing katas in general. I mentioned in my post yesterday that the opportunity to focus wholeheartedly on the fundamentals was beneficial me to in a myriad of ways. That feeling persisted today as I experimented with different ways to complete the kata in order to decrease the time it takes me to complete it.</p>
<p>Apart from gaining proficiency with the VirtualStudio keyboard shortcuts and my own touch typing, through discussion with another apprentice I decided to try and use a C# dictionary in an attempt to reduce duplication and improve speed. However, despite the novelty of this tiny innovation, I wasn't able to gain much of an advantage. It still required too much set-up and it decreased the readability of the code.</p>
<p>Given that I couldn't come up with much else in terms of optimization, I became quite fixated on the idea of having one test that iterated through a variable amount of test cases. The dictionary wasn't doing so I consulted Myles to see if there was another way. As is often the case in programming, there was.</p>
<p>Myles introduced me to some of the benefits of xUnit a testing tool for the .NET framework, as well as some very helpful syntactic sugar in C#, and a glimpse of LINQ (I'm sure this is an impending post). Anyway, in xUnit uses two types* of attributes when creating unit tests [Fact] and [Theory], I really love their reasoning:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Facts</strong> are tests which are always true. They test invariant conditions.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Theories</strong> are tests which are only true for a particular set of data.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So as you might suspect, a theory implies variable data. xUnit has a pretty cool way to handle this with the use of of the [InlineData] attribute. Here's an example: the finished product of my tests after completing the prime factors kata.</p>
<p>[code language="C#"]</p>
<p>[Theory]<br />
[InlineData (new [] {}, 1)]<br />
[InlineData (new [] {2}, 2)]<br />
[InlineData (new [] {3}, 3)]<br />
[InlineData (new [] {2,2}, 4)]<br />
[InlineData (new [] {2,3}, 6)]<br />
[InlineData (new [] {2,2,2}, 8)]<br />
[InlineData (new [] {3,3}, 9)]<br />
public void TestPrimeFactorsGenerator(List&lt;int&gt; expectedPrimes, int num) {<br />
    Assert.Equal(expectedPrimes, PrimeFactors.Generate(num));<br />
}</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>One caveat regarding the use of the [InlineData] attribute: it only works with system defined types. With this new implementation I'm hovering around a 10 minute performance with several more rehearsals I hope to get the entire performance somewhere between 5 and 10.</p>
