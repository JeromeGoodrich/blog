I had resolved to fill my notebook by today. I maybe have an eighth of it
left. I didn't reach my goal. In the past, I would have counted this as
a failure. Today, I felt some fleeting dissapointment when I realized
I had reached the deadline, but that's it. The goal was not the point this
time around.

I wanted to be someone who lived their life with clarity and intention. So
I decided I would try and fill the pages of my journal by journaling or
drawing. The goal, was just a little boost to encourage me to write and
draw more. Since I made the goal, I've only missed a handful of days and
on some days wrote 10x what I have in the past.

It doesn't matter if the goal doesn't work out if the system stays.
