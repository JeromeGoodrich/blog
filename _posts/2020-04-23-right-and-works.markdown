Often we are confronted by the tension between what's "right" and what
works. What's "right" is typically something handed downâ€“what we're
supposed to do, what we think is expected of us. When what's "right"
doesn't work it makes us unhappy. It's not what we want to do. It's not
aligned with our values. Choosing what works, is choosing ourselves. When
we choose ourselves we choose vulnerability and exposure. We open
ourselves to being wrong and to the pain of rebuke. To choose what works
we need to be able to realize we have options and create a filter around
what is useful to us.
