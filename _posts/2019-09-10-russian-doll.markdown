Sometimes history repeats itself. It's up to us if we learn from it or
not. I have slumps that appear out of no where. multi-day benders of bad
decision making. Sometimes it feels like just the wrong domino toppled.
A singular decision cascaded into much worse ones. But maybe it's just
cyclical. Some hormonal shit. It's time to start digging deeperâ€“Russian
Doll style.
