I'm looking to my right at a mess on the shelves next to my desk. I'm
wondering if I should be cleaning it instead. It feels more productive
than staring at a blank screen trying to hit on some observation or
opinion with which I can start a post. Instead, it seems like this one
will be just another stream of consciousness. What's wrong with that?
Sure, it's not what I set out to doâ€“this isn't meant to be a journal, but
beggars can't be choosers, and if this is what comes out sometimes (most
of the time) so be it.

I started writing daily because Seth Godin said it was a good idea and
I agreed with him. I don't remember his exact reasoning, nor have I ever
really looked at his blog, but doing something consistently related to
writing seems like a good idea for someone interested in becoming
a writer. Again, 9 days in, I think just getting words, whatever they are
on the page is good enough. However, there's the part of me that wants
more. That wants to be building up to something, practicing something,
getting better.

For now, though I think it's important to not get distracted by the shiny
new thing. Part of where I failed in the past is giving up on the boring
current thing in favor of the shiny new thing. I don't want that to happen
again.
