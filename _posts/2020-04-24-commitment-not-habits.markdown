Habits are a manifestation of a commitment to one's values and identity.
The habits we have reaffirm who we are, but it's the commitment and intent
to become that person that matters most. Those tiny, repeated actions we
call habits are just the way we show that commitment. All this to say that
when our lives inevitably change we may find our current routines
untenable. When this happens, it's easy to feel like we've had the ground
ripped out from underneath us. However, as long as we retain our
commitment to being the type of person we want to beâ€“as long as we commit
to our values, we will find our way back to the habits that work for us.
